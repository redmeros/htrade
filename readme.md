# Htrade

Htrade is my hobby project for collecting data from forex currency pairs, and analyse it.

## Why so stupid name

I belive that for this project name no matter. But the first one I wrote was gtrade (because of language used), and have delete it. H is the next
letter in the alphabet

## Roadmap

- [x] collecting data
- [ ] frontend for showing data
- [ ] analysers

## I'm not a programmer

Small disclaimer - my code is terrible I know, I could make this repo private because I think nobody will use it. It will never be stable it will never be as good as open source should be. But I'm using a lot of job of many people so I don't know why I should not share.

Feel free to pull request, or comment I'll try my best to handle everything.
